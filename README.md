# ItemMining-and-Recommendor-System
Our team of developers has been tasked with creating a system for a grocery store to identify frequently
bought itemsets by customers, in order to group them together for increased sales. Additionally, we will
recommend products from these itemsets to customers on the store's website. We have implemented
three models to achieve this purpose. All of our models utilise a dataset which was generated by using a
loyalty programme to gather customer transaction data, which we have used to identify frequent
itemsets. These models are end to end, meaning they take the dataset as the input and produce
recommendations as output. We have tested the models with 27,000 transactions and have found that it
is feasible to scale the solution to one million customers with the power of parallel processing and better
computer hardware. Out of the three models which we have tested, one of them, namely Collaborative
Filtering through KNN, is an effective method for recommending products to customers. The benefits of
using this model for the grocery store include increased sales by grouping frequently bought itemsets
together and recommending these products to customers. The system is scalable, meaning it can handle
increasing transaction volumes. Furthermore, the implementation of this system will position the
grocery store as a leader in using data-driven solutions for enhancing the customer experience and
increasing sales
